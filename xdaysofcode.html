                            In last days I spent my time to find a topic and a good website to do web scraping. And today i collected some of them from a online sales website. I wanna make a end to end data science project, so this one is first step. I collected data about phones, laptops, all in one pcs' and tablets. Now I have a real world dataset with more than 5k rows. Now there is so much things to do like cleaning/ standardizing.
                            <li> I followed a path like:</li>
                            <ul><li>Taking urls of whole pages</li>
                                <li>Taking urls of whole products on each pages</li>
                                <li>Taking features and values of all products</li>
                            </ul>
                            <li>I took 5k+ rows of data and more than 150 features.</li>
