                <p>Hi
                    Actually most of my daily routine is going with coding around data science / data engineering. So I
                    think that I can share some of them here.

                    <br> This is a hard 'find the x' question. And I think I wont find the x soon.
                <div>
                    <script src="https://gist.github.com/bilative/1e4b4a441b71b074e2217d66b5e983c3.js"></script>
                </div>
                <li> The things I shared in this repo are only about what I search, what I learn and How am I improving
                    myself. </li>
                <li> This is kinda learning path. Mostly I learn, rarely I create new things. I working on my side
                    projects after working days and weekends.
                    So frequency of the new things may be low. </li>
                <li> Whole weekdays I'm working at an office, And the things that I shared are about "WHAT I'M DOING
                    AFTER WORK / WEEKEND".</li>
                <li> Small steps are gonna be in this repo but big pictures is gonna be in their own repos. (I'll link
                    them) </li>
                <b>NOTE: </b> The codes I have shared are only sample of whole picture. </li>
                <br> I'll update how my process is going. You can check it. </li>
                </p>

            <p><b>Today I got job offer as Data Analysis Specialist from "Hepsiburada" - ecommerce company that I mentioned #days52 to days 57-. In the new year, my level of knowledge will increase a lot. My learning process/trend continue to raise sharper. </b><p>
            <p>And yea, today I code again. With my Data Science team, we did some fixes and committed our latest prediction of the test set. So there is nothing to do with project. 2 days later we'll present our process.</p>

            <div class="dayoff">90-92 (12-14.11.2021)</div>
            <p>Friday I solved my Data Structures and Algorithms homework questions with c. <a href="https://github.com/bilative/99problems-ft-bilal/tree/master/data-structures-and-algorithms-homeworks">Here</a>  is the codes. Actually I had no so much experience with c, and lecturer wanted this: "We should solve problems with no math functions. My codes work well.</p>
            <li>And in this 3 days we built our model with my Data Science Bootcamp team.</li>
            <li>Bootcamp organisation wanted best f1 score from us. Actually only f1 score is not good metric for our success I think. But we tried it.</li>
            <li>Btw our f1_score is so bad :D it's about %60-62, but I think we can present it well with a ROC-Curve and our preprocessing and feature engineering part.</li>
            <p>We'll see.</p>
            <hr>
                                      
            <div class="dayoff">Day off (11.11.2021)</div>
            <p>Today we went a "developers meeting" to a bar with my friend. I meet more than 20 people there. There were awesome guyz :D </p>
            <hr>
                          
            <div class="dayoff">87-89 (08-10.11.2021)</div>
            <p>We started building model part of our Data Science Bootcamp Project. And we did a statistically succesfull approach about feature engineering parts.</p>
            <li>We have 24 sequential month columns. Actually this 24 sequential months are started from different month for every observation/rows. The only information we have they are sequential.</li>
            <li>In this situation we cant say that Month_1 is same month for every of them.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>For observation_1 month_1 = January, month_2 = Jebruary maybe but, for observation_2 month_1 could be equal to March, and month_2 = April.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>So generalization is not possible with all columns. For example when we check correlation, coefficients wouldnt be logical. Because we cant compare same months like this.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>So we decided to take difference of all sequential (with 12month lag) months, so we get 12 difference scores.</li>
                <li>And we calculated some statistics, and standardize them. This approach gave us some logical patterns.</li>
                <li>I liked our approach so much :D</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="dayoff">85-86 (06-07.11.2021)</div>
            <p>Whole weekend I was with my Data Science Bootcamp team. We understood electricity data and decided how we can handle with the problems.</p>
            <li>At the same time Sunday there was last lesson of the Data Science Bootcamp (7 week over). And we presented our study to lecturer. We took some advices.</li>
            <li>Actually members of my whole team are from different branches. And some of them dodnt know the topic well. So this project weeks are felt me like a lecturer. I explained everysteps, and their minds are little confused.</li>
            <li>I wanna follow the steps I decided but we decide together, so some of the steps didnt gone like I wanted. This is a team work, it is good with this types of pieces maybe Idk :D</li>

            <div class="dayoff">Day off (04-05.11.2021)</div>
            <p>I have a lot of homework in my graduate classes. I did my homework these 2 days.</p>
            <hr>
                        
            <div class="dayoff">Day 84 (03.11.2021)</div>
            <p>I'm in project week with my Data Science Bootcamp. We'll analyze Theft and Loss Estimation data about electricity.</p>
            <li>This week's topic understanding the data and preprocess it before building model steps.</li>
            <li>I found a really important data leak on dataset, lol. They'll update the dataset and give it to all teams again.</li>
            <hr>
            
            <div class="dayoff">Day 84 (02.11.2021)</div>
            <p>Today I had data engineering bootcamp. We learned/repeated some about spark and hadoop.</p>
            <p>And we talked about our projects, I'll built a project with twitter API.</p>
            <hr>
            
            <div class="dayoff">Day 83 (01.11.2021)</div>
            <p> Today's topic is technical interview about my project (from day 57) with a huge e-commerce company :D </p>
            <li>I feel so happy, bc my interview gone very well. They asked questions about every steps of my project. And I explained every point.</li>
            <li>I had some little mistakes and I fixed them in seconds front of them, and I did some live coding on living application.</li>
            <li>I thought that I had some mistakes about markov chain and funnel analysis questions. But they said that everything is good, my approach was little different but right and my answers is true they said.</li>
            <hr>

            <div class="dayoff">Day 82 (31.10.2021)</div>
            <p>I had 5 hours lesson today with Data Science Bootcamp. We studied about Time Series Analysis. Actually this area smth I knew, I refreshed my knowledge. </p>
            <p>And I have a important technical meeting tomorrow. So I studied some theorical and applied parts to be ready. So I feel good :d </p>
            <hr>


            <div class="dayoff">Day 80-81 (29-30.10.2021)</div>
            <p>Along with this 2 days I focused 2 topic</p>
            <li> First one; I have a meeting about a project that I finished 1 month ago, so I forget most of the
                details. I studied about the project again. I studied on the parts that others could ask questions.</li>
            <li>And I had a hm from my Data Science Bootcamp. I stuied about it. There was some good questions like:
            </li>
            <ul>
                <li>How can you handle with the classes that not included by training set? or Probability threshold of a
                    classifier how could effect the result? etc.</li>
                <li>Actually there is some available solutions. But I handled with them again and It was informative
                    experience to handle these in a hw. </li>
            </ul>
            <hr>


            <div class="dayoff">Day 79 (28.10.2021)</div>
            <p>I searched some about creating stream data APIs and I tried some. Actually creating API with web scraping
                looks not true way.</p>
            <li>And I decided create API from my own application. I dont know how but I tried some today. I can watch
                the logs of my website; I can take every clickstream data -events as data. Actually docker logs show
                them to me, so It could be possible.</li>
            <li>I tried to send them kafka and I think this must be the right way to create an API. If it'll be
                live-stream this scenario looks ok.</li>
            <li>Actually most of my trials was between Kafka-docker-web application and python today but I learned so
                much today.</li>
            <hr>


            <div class="dayoff">Day 78 (27.10.2021)</div>
            <p>I searched some concepts and created a basic example of my next <b>Web Scraping</b> blog post.</p>
            <p>And I did my homeworks of master/university lessons. (This was not directly about coding but the logic).
            </p>
            <hr>


            <div class="dayoff">Day 77 (26.10.2021)</div>
            <p>Today there was Data Engineering Bootcamp and we deep dive Spark and Kafka usage again.</p>
            <li>And I talked about my NiFi project little bit. And I took some advices and bad feedbacks. I'll publish
                my project but I should create better one later again.</li>
            <hr>

            <div class="dayoff">Day Off (25.10.2021)</div>
            <p>Day Off. I visited my ex university (statistics department) and talked with my teachers. Today was so
                good.</p>
            <p>And in the end of the day there was a meeting with my blog community (SistersLab).</p>
            <hr>

            <div class="dayoff">Day 76 (24.10.2021)</div>
            <p>Full day I had Data Science Bootcamp. We started to explore analysing steps, and which little touches we
                should do.</p>
            <li>At the same time we studied about optimization.</li>
            <li>And I should share this; I realized big mistake in the course about train_test_split and
                standardization. Common big mistake faced me again in the course. And I explained true way to handle
                with this situation, statistician part of me banged hist fist on the table :D</li>
            <hr>


            <div class="dayoff">Day 74-75 (22-23.10.2021)</div>
            <p>I studied again my old data engineering notes. And I updated my NiFi project. I added MongoDB writing
                processor.</p>
            <p>I tried to make my own stream data API, but after that I realize this is not actually live stream, so I
                didnt add this to project but It was good things to try.</p>
            <li>And I realized today, There is a dump part on my twitter boot application. I was reading all website
                with web scraping but xml parts required different handling strategies, I realized it now. So I'll
                update repo soon. </li>
            <li><b>I published blog NiFi project blog post <a

            <div class="dayoff">Day off (21.10.2021)</div>
            <p>Day off, I dont count today. I created my good looking CV.</p>
            <li>Glad to see that my CV has been starting to fill with good points :D</li>
            <hr>

            <div class="dayoff">Day 73 (20.10.2021)</div>
            <p>Today after working day there was additional lesson on my Data Science Bootcamp. </p>
            <li>Actually there is no special gain but we solved some dataframe manipualation problems. Some of the
                problems solved by pandas but some of them required some specific functions. </li>
            <hr>

            <div class="dayoff">Day 72 (19.10.2021)</div>
            <p>Today I had a course on Data Engineering Bootcamp. And we started to explore cloudera system deeply. </p>
            <li>How can we manage cluster and Which type of controls we should do on the system (for example we should
                check YARN for status about the system sources) </li>
            <li>And we did some example on zeppelin. How we can read data from HDFS by spark, and connection types
                between pyspark and sql on zeppelin.</li>
            <p>I'll watch this lesson again and study about it soon. There was so much details.</p>
            <hr>

            <div class="dayoff">Day 70-71 (17-18.10.2021)</div>
            <li>I launched a vm on Google Cloud Platform and started a data engineering project. </li>
            <li>I installed nifi, kafka and docker on it. And I set nifi mysql connection between them. My application
                fed by stream data again. I'll share it here after I finish it. </li>
            <li>And today I had a lesson with in Data Science Bootcamp. I made live coding with the lecturer.</li>
            <li>Content of the lesson was about insurance dataset. This was first time that I took insigt about
                insurance data. This was one of the lackness of mine but Today I learned some about oversampling and
                undersampling and the use cases.</li>
            <hr>

            <div class="dayoff">Day 69 (16.10.2021)</div>
            <li>Today there was no one big piece but many little one.</li>
            <li>I wrote latest version of my Web Scraping blog post. And I showed some coding parts in it.</li>
            <li>We did a group work assignment with my Data Science Bootcamp team. Before the analysis, we visualized
                the variables and preprocessed the dataset (with 80 variables).</li>
            <hr>

            <div class="dayoff">Day 68 (15.10.2021)</div>
            <li>Today I decided latest version of the page that I'll use on my Web Scraping Blog Post.</li>
            <li>And I write the coding part in a notebook. In next couple days I'll write the post. <a
                    href="https://bilative.github.io/sisterslab/web_scraping"> Here </a> is the web page I created:

            <div class="dayoff">Day Off (14.10.2021)</div>
            <li> I wasn't feeling well today. I didnt do any spesific thing. </li>
            <hr>

            <div class="dayoff">Day 67 (13.10.2021)</div>
            <li> Today I didnt spend my time effectively enough. My energy was so low. </li>
            <li> There was additional course of my Data Science Bootcamp. We took some theorical knowledges about
                univariate and multivariate outliers / anomaly detections. </li>
            <li>I tried some basic steps about web scraping to write my blog post better.</li>
            <li>My energy level of today was %35. </li>
            <hr>


            <div class="dayoff">Day 66 (12.10.2021)</div>
            <li> Today I changed my focusing area little bit. I'll write a blog post for SistersLab, and my next blog
                series gonna be about web scraping. </li>
            <li> Actually scraping data without permission looks little illegal. And showing the method all the people
                who read blog is also not good without permission. </li>
            <li> So I decided to create my own web page to give my example about web scraping. </li>
            <li> Today I created a web page on github-pages to scrape. This is only a draft now, I'll whare here it when
                I finish. </li>
            <hr>


            <div class="dayoff">Day 65 (11.10.2021)</div>
            <li> Today I discuessed with my senior colleagues about Kafka, Nifi and some other message queue tools, and
                their use cases/reasons. </li>
            <li> And after woking day I connected Kafka with Python. And I sent data from Python to trigger some events
                on Nifi. </li>
            <ul>
                <li> So I sent data from Python to Kafka as producer </li>
                <li> Connedted Kafka with Nifi </li>
                <li> Kafka took data/messages and processed with Nifi </li>
                <li> And some conditions triggered Slack to send message</li>
            </ul>
            <hr>


            <div class="dayoff">Day 61-64 (07-10.10.2021)</div>
            <li> In these days I studied about Nifi and Kafka. Actually this 2 are not directly coding maybe but they
                count for a data scientist / engineer I think.</li>
            <li> I recreated some projects that allready created, and I took some insight. </li>
            <li> Then I took some data from stream data APIs with Nifi and made some ETL processing. </li>
            <ul>
                <li> Used JoltTransformJSON and the queries to select and transform data. (JoltTransformJSON is a good
                    processor but little complicated for some tasks) </li>
                <li> Created some new fetures to trigger some events. </li>
                <li> Triggered Slack and ElasticSearch with the results. (I send message to Slack and wrote data to
                    ElasticSearch) </li>
            </ul>
            <li> Additionally </li>
            <ul>
                <li> I connected nifi with Kafka. </li>
                <li> But I'm so fresh with Kafka, so I produced data from only bash of terminal (ubuntu). So there is no
                    datasource yet. </li>
            </ul>
            <li> <b>NOTE:</b> I made everything on my local ubuntu machine. Elesticsearch website/account and My slack
                workspace. </li>
            <li> Most of my times passed with trying and failing. I tried this steps with more than 5 stream data APIs
                (exchanges, flighs, crypto currencies etc) </li>

            <div class="dayoff">Day 60 (06.10.2021)</div>
            <li> After working day I studied about HDFS on big data cluster. I made so much mistake when I run the
                command and couple times I was lost in the system. But Ok. After practicing I feel more confortable with
                the opeartions in file system. And sandbox also helped me a lot to check my operations.</li>
            <li>And I finished the homework of my Data Science Bootcamp. There was a question about "Effect size". Oh my
                old friend <b>Meta Analysis</b>. </li>
            <hr>

            <div class="dayoff">Day 59 (05.10.2021)</div>
            <li> Today I had a lesson on Data Engineering Bootcamp. And today we learn some about HDFS. </li>
            <li> We connected a cluster and managed it with sandbox. At the same time mostly we practice on terminal.
            </li>
            <li> We sent some tables from mysql to cluster. And we study on some tricks and rules. </li>
            <li> Actually this is smth little hard to understand. So I'l practice with it couple days more. At the same
                time it's so cool!! </li>
            <li> <b> NOTE: </b> Btw Im on 2 bootcamp about 2 weeks. Data Engineering Bootcample started 4 months ago,
                and Data Science bootcamp started 3 weeks ago.
                Data Science bootcamp is on weekend (2 additional lesson at weekdays) and Data Engineering one at
                Tuesdays and Thursdays.</li>

            <div class="dayoff">Day 58 (04.10.2021)</div>
            <li> Today after work I study about my Data Science Bootcamp tasks. I had some homeworks (generally easy
                things). </li>
            <li> And I studied on some data structures and algorithm chapters. </li>
            <hr>

            <div class="dayoff">Day 57 (03.10.2021)</div>
            <p>Today I finished my project, later deployed it on cloud linux machine and watched logs to check are there
                any problem. And All done.</p>
            <p>This week has been very tiring. Time to evaluate myself / process: </p>

                    <b>PROS</b>
                    <li> I show them multiple skills in a test step. In this project I used: </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li> Python, Flask/Dash, Docker, Linux </li>
                    </ul>
                    <li> I experienced how to apply Markov Chain. I'm wondering this area and this process was my
                        first step with Markov Chain. </li>
                    <li> They wanted only results and presentation but I gave them interactive web app / dashboard.
                        So I gave them multiple combinations of the information about data. </li>
                    <li> My web app is so clean. So understanding someone else's code little hard maybe. And seeing
                        so much paragraph in a page so ugly, but in my design I gave them it so clean. </li>

                    <b>CONS</b>
                    <li> I failed on Funnel Analysis step. I though that I could solve this preblem on last day, But
                        I couldnt, didnt understand concept clearly in a day. </li>
                    <li> I didnt used sql. This project requires SQL but I had some problems with docker with SQL so
                        I didnt use it, this is really bad situation for a data scientist. </li>
                    <li> Designing app took so much time. I should create a free template for the days like this
                        maybe, I dont know. But creating app from zero took so much time. </li>
                    <li> I dont know e-commerce data analysis tricks well. So I felt like a freshman. If I could be
                        better about e-commerce data analysis, it could be great. I should study about the concept
                        about e-commerce. </li>
                    <li><b>I found a mistake on my app, after I sent ip:port of my application. I didnt touch it
                            after this, They should see the mistake (Bc I did it!) </b></li>

                <ul>
                    <li> I should only add title for the plots, they will be dynamic but its ok, I can solve it less
                        than 1 hour.</li>
                </ul>
                <li> Business report task: 100% finished </li>

            <p> Today after working day I continue to implement KPI task to web app. Visually everything is ok now.</p>
            <ul>
                <li> But Details are so much you know. There is some problems with the comment-plot couples. </li>
                <Most of them no problem but in some cases there is so much thing to do. </li>
            </ul>
            <li> I stated handle with markov chain question. Actually I solved most of it but There is some questions on
                my mind, Some of the consepts are not clear for me yet. </li>
            <li> I imlemented Business Report questions to web app. </li>
            <ul>
                <li> I took screenshots of the codes, Im showing them with the comments. </li>
                <li> But I dont keep them in folder/local. I upload them to github-issues, so github created a link for
                    me. This is little tricky and awesome thing :D </li>

                        more details to do. </li>
                    <li> All the tables created, comments and plots-dropdowns connections should fix, there is some

                    <li>I searched some notebooks about funnel analysis, but this task seems little hard for this week

            <div class="dayoff">Day 54 (30.09.2021)</div>
            <p> Today after working day continueing was so tiring for me</p>
            <li> I created a layout for KPIs questions (showing descriptive statistics). </li>
            <li> For each entity I creted a cardbody and in this card there is some tools (like dropdowns and date
                pickers) to specify visuals. and I added comments for each possible situation vor each question. So
                there are about 3*8 = 24 paragraph comment about visuals </li>
            <li> I should create summary statistics tables for entities but day ended so quickly, so maybe tomorrow I
                can solve this. </li>
            <li> As a summary of my 2/5 days my process is smth like this: </li>
            <ul>
                <li> Descriptive statistics task: 50% finished </li>
                <ul>
                    <li> summary tables'll be added </li>
                    <li> for last 3 entity dynamic visuals'll be created </li>
                </ul>
                <li> Business report task: 65% finished </li>
                <ul>
                    <li> Some repetitive tasks'll convert functions </li>
                    <li> Results'll implement to dashboard/dash app </li>
                </ul>
                <li> Funnel Analysis: not started yet </li>
                <ul>
                    <li> I read some articles about funnel analysis, so I have some insight about the task. I think I'll
                        handle with this task well. </li>
                </ul>
                <p>NOTE: I missed the service bus in the morning, I couldn't wake up :D </p>

            <div class="dayoff">Day 53 (29.09.2021)</div>
            <li> After working day I solved almost all 8 questions well, but there are some details to fix. Next step is
                gonna create dynamic dashboard with them. </li>
            <li> There are about 8 complex question about multiple datasets in test cases. For the solutions I should
                make them join. And I think true way to solve them is writing queries in SQL, but
                actaully I'll create a dashboard with dash end of the tasks. And I think it is ok to writing the queries
                in python (but I know this could not best option).
                <ul>
                    <li> I chose not to use SQL bc, I'll publish my app with docker on linux cloud machine. And I have
                        some problem to create SQL on docker and manage it.
                        Yea I know mysql could be good option on docker but as I said, this could make my process harder
                        and this is a task that time consuming for me in this situation.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li> There is a question about funnel analysis on the test cases, and I heared funnel analysis first time in
                this cases. So I searched about it and read some articles, blog post about the idea behind it and the
                applying steps. </li>
            <li> And I searched and tried to understand some github repos / projects about funnel analysis, I think it
                seems ok to solve the problem. </li>
            <br>
            NOTE: Actaully I remember something like "funnel plot" from my graduation project of Univerty years. It is
            about Meta Analysis, and the scope of the data. </br>

            <div class="dayoff">Day 52 (28.09.2021)</div>
            <li> I got some test questions of a e-commerce company today. And I set a deadline of 5 days for tasks.
            </li>
            <li> Actually I didnt study on e-commerce data before, but I think I can learn and handle with them well.
            </li>
            <li> One of the cons is I work full time in first 3 days. (last 2 days are weekend) </li>
            <li> Till end of the day I tried to understand cases and the problems that they wantted from me to solve. So
                some trials and descriptive analysis. </li>

            <div class="dayoff">Day 51 (27.09.2021)</div>

                courses under Kodluyoruz / Patika Data Science Bootcamp homeworks. </li>
            <hr>

            <div class="dayoff">Day 50 (26.09.2021)</div>
            <li> Today it was first day of my "Enerjisa Data Science Bootcamp" with Kodluyoruz. We talked mostly general
                things. Actually there was no any coding. </li>
            <li> After course I solved some interview algorithm problems. </li>
            <li> Rest of the day I rerun some of the github repos about CNNs. </li>

            <div class="day41">Day 48 (22.09.2021)</div>
            <li> I studied ANNs on my old regression tasks. Actually I know and I belive that for tabular tasks ANNs are
                not good. Mostly
                tree based models kick ANNs ass but I tried different combinations to improve flexibility of my
                knowledge on deep learning.</li>

            <div class="day41">Day 47 (21.09.2021)</div>
            <li> Today I added the x-days-of-process heatmap (like github commit heatmap) to this page. </li>
            <li>And I'll take GoLang course rest of the day.</li>

            <div class="day41">Day 46 (20.09.2021)</div>
            <li> Today after work I concated Flask blog website and my dash app [this
                one](https://github.com/bilative/weekend-end-to-end-ds-project). I give a "a tag" somewhere and it
                direct to dash dashboard page with same base url. So there is only 1 app, I didnt combined 2 different
                app, I concated them into 1 file. This was good experience for me, bc I've been thinking about this for
                a long time if this is possible or not. </li>

            <div class="day41">Day 44-45 (18-19.09.2021)</div>
            <li>Along with these 2 days in day time I worked about flask to create a blog website for myself. I wanna
                host my own blog website, with 4 main pages and subpages for 2 concepts.
                Acutally my process gone well. Firstly I built copy of this website (github pages). Github pages is
                static website, and I think it is not enough usefull. Bu I build copy of this with Flask, and I made it
                dynamic.
                I related my daily posts with databse and Flask backend, It's look is good now. There is some additional
                features. MAybe in short term I can carry my page to my own domain name.</li>
            <li>In night times I took course about GoLang, actually I think this 12 days with GoLang could be good for
                me. Maybe I can create a repo about GoLang, and improve myself in long term. Why Not??</li>

            <p>Hey, I've been accepted to a data science bootcamp. I will be in a 6-week bootcamp, It is starting next
                week.</p>
            <p>And today after work I took a 3 hours basic GoLang course. Tomorrow I'll start a GoLang bootcamp at the
                same time, this study class will take 12 days, I wanna be ready enough for this journey.
                And yeap, Go looks cool.

                I upped the gear in my deep learning process. During these days, I read the second part of Geron's
                book "Hands on ML". Actually I read the first part of older version of the book last year, and I liked
                it so much. But first edition of the book was about tensorflow 1, so I read early release of second
                edition with tensorflow 2.
                <li>I decided to specialize in tensorflow for 3-4 months, if necessary I will adapt to pytorch later.
                </li>
                <li>At the same time I applied and observed the steps on code by <a

                <li>And I upgraded my local tensorflow to GPU version. Actually after all things I realized that it was
                    so easy to configure CUDA and CuDNN but they took so much time.</li>

                I started to study on deep learning again. Actually I had notes from last year about CNNs, I checked
                them again and I took some courses.
                And I'm in a 4 days mini bootcamp(with a community) about deep learning. I checked some examples and
                apply them step by step to understand to idea behind them.
                Actually I really refreshed my knowledge again and my passion increased again.
                <li> I decided to take photos of 5-6 different items more than 100 times every of them and crete my own
                    image dataset. And I'll upload it to kaggle and analyze them with CNN. This is good idea I think,
                    we'll see.... </li>

                I updated my twitter-earthquake-bot couple days ago. And I faced with some problems. These are:
                <li>Kandilli Rasathanesi could update earthquake infos after couple minutes. And the update info breaks
                    my web scraping script. So I solved this step with additional "try-except rows".</li>
                <li>And I added image of the map that earthquake occured. But this required some searhing process, bc
                    twitter API want to read images from local. So I should did convert map images from html to png and
                    save. Views of maps in python geoplot libs are in html form, this took some time from me.</li>
                <li>And I specified a threshold for earthquake so my bot alerts for earthquakes that greater than 4.
                </li>
                <br>
                (I added the photo afer 20 days bc there was no clear output bc of the threshold last 20 days)

                <li>Actually I'm feeling like I should carry some of my tasks Python to Java.</li>
                <li>I started to solve some Hackerrank problems to make my Java skills to ready for different problems.

                <br> Actually I'm kinda lucky bc My database has blown up in couple of weeks (so quickly). And on

                Maybe later I could made big projects with no enough security. I'm feeling lucky (and dumpy :d)

                <li>ssh connection to remote machine with windows command prompt (ssh my_user@my_ip)</li>
                <li>docker save and load image command to send saved image to remote machine</li>

                    Cetin Elmas. Actually I bought thos book couple weeks ago, and today I have started to read it and
                    apply. I refreshed my knowledges and I started to learn some mores.

                    I started to handle with the data I collected yesterday. None values and the data with no standard
                    is a big problem. Today I worked on them about 2 hours. But there is more to do. None and nan are
                    not acting same. I understood this so bad.

                    In last days I spent my time to find a topic and a good website to do web scraping. And today i
                    collected some of them from a online sales website. I wanna make a end to end data science project,
                    so this one is first step. I collected data about phones, laptops, all in one pcs' and tablets. Now
                    I have a real world dataset with more than 5k rows. Now there is so much things to do like cleaning/
                    standardizing.
                    <li> I followed a path like:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Taking urls of whole pages</li>
                    <li>Taking urls of whole products on each pages</li>
                    <li>Taking features and values of all products</li>
                </ul>
                <li>I took 5k+ rows of data and more than 150 features.</li>
