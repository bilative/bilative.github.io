                        Today I deployed my <a href="https://github.com/bilative/twitter-earthquake-bot">twitter-eartquake-bot</a> application on cloud linux machine. Normally I'm using linux with interface but on cloud machine there is no interface, so deploying steps required some new codes to write for me. I learned usefull things today like:
                        <li>ssh connection to remote machine with windows command prompt (ssh my_user@my_ip)</li>
                        <li>docker save and load image command to send saved image to remote machine</li>
                        <li>scp command to send saved image to remote machine (scp windows_path/file.tar linux_user@linux_ip:/path)</li>
                        <li>And at the same time I used cli connection to my docker container.</li>
                        I used to do these with interface mostly, So today is so today has been a lot of fun for me. And twitter bot is active now 7/24, if there is a earthquake bigger than 4, bot will tweet it by <a href="https://twitter.com/bilallozdemir">my twitter account</a>.

                        Today I started to analyze the data I scraped online store. But after start to know data and analyze I realize that variation on independent variables are not enough. I was aim to predict Prices' of the products but prices are seem not continious variable to use regression. Im talking like this bc prizes are like 6499, 6999, 7499...
                        <ul><li>There are about 3600 product but there is 18 different price labels.</li>

                        <br>And today I solve some problem in an exam. There was an sql question in the exam, and it was smth like this:
