                <p>Hi
                    Actually most of my daily routine is going with coding around data science / data engineering. So I
                    think that I can share some of them here.

                    <br> This is a hard 'find the x' question. And I think I wont find the x soon.
                <div>
                    <script src="https://gist.github.com/bilative/1e4b4a441b71b074e2217d66b5e983c3.js"></script>
                </div>
                <li> The things I shared in this repo are only about what I search, what I learn and what am I improving
                    myself. </li>
                <li> I working on my side projects after working days and weekends. So frequency of the new things could
                    may be low. </li>
                <li> Whole weekdays I'm working at an office, And the things that I shared are about "WHAT I'M DOING
                    AFTER WORK / WEEKEND".</li>
                <li> Small steps are gonna be in this repo but big pictures is gonna be in their own repos. (I'll link
                    them) </li>
                <b>NOTE: </b> The codes I have shared are only sample of whole picture. </li>
                <br> I'll update my how my process is going here. You can check it. </li>
                </p>

                one](https://github.com/bilative/weekend-end-to-end-ds-project). I give a "a tag" somewhere and it
                direct to dash dashboard page with same base url. So there is only 1 app, I didnt combined 2 different
                app, I concated them into 1 file. This was good experience for me, bc I've been thinking about this for
                a long time if this is possible or not. </li>

            <li>Along with these 2 days in day time I worked about flask to create a blog website for myself. I wanna
                host my own blog website, with 4 main pages and subpages for 2 concepts.
                Acutally my process gone well. Firstly I built copy of this website (github pages). Github pages is
                static website, and I think it is not enough usefull. Bu I build copy of this with Flask, and I made it
                dynamic.
                I related my daily posts with databse and Flask backend, It's look is good now. There is some additional
                features. MAybe in short term I can carry my page to my own domain name.</li>
            <li>In night times I took course about GoLang, actually I think this 12 days with GoLang could be good for
                me. Maybe I can create a repo about GoLang, and improve myself in long term. Why Not??</li>

                week.</p>
            <p>And today after work I took a 3 hours basic GoLang course. Tomorrow I'll start a GoLang bootcamp at the
                same time, this study class will take 12 days, I wanna be ready enough for this journey.
                And yeap, Go looks cool.

                I upped the gear in my deep learning process. During these days, I read the second part of Geron's
                book "Hands on ML". Actually I read the first part of older version of the book last year, and I liked
                it so much. But first edition of the book was about tensorflow 1, so I read early release of second
                edition with tensorflow 2.

                And I'm in a 4 days mini bootcamp(with a community) about deep learning. I checked some examples and

                    my web scraping script. So I solved this step with additional "try-except rows".</li>
                <li>And I added image of the map that earthquake occured. But this required some searhing process, bc
                    twitter API want to read images from local. So I should did convert map images from html to png and
                    save. Views of maps in python geoplot libs are in html form, this took some time from me.</li>
                <li>And I specified a threshold for earthquake so my bot alerts for earthquakes that greater than 4.

                Today I searched some Java apps. And I solved some entry level Java problems on Hackerrank. I'm at the
                begining of the Java. But I'm taking small steps. In short term maybe I wont be good at it but, in long
                term (maybe in 2 year) I know that I'll use it fluently.

            <ul>
                <li>I redesigned some of my projects design to fit "Model Viev Controler".</li>

                Today I started to analyze the data I scraped online store. But after start to know data and analyze I
                realize that variation on independent variables are not enough. I was aim to predict Prices' of the
                products but prices are seem not continious variable to use regression. Im talking like this bc prizes
                are like 6499, 6999, 7499...

                    I have a real world dataset with more than 5k rows. Now there is so much things to do like cleaning/
